    <p>The Java Management Extension (JMX) allows monitoring and control an
    already running program, locally or remote. The runtime environment
    provides already several so-called <i>platform MXBeans</i> (for
    &quot;managed bean&quot;), covering some general topics, like garbage
    collection or logging. These can be found in the package
    {@link java.lang.management}.</p>
    <p>But to make specific features of a program accessible via JMX, it is
    necessary to provide own MBeans; this can be done by implementing the
    interface
    {@link javax.management.DynamicMBean}.</p>
    <p>This is what the class
    {@link org.tquadrat.foundation.mgmt.JMXSupport}
    does: it is a generic implementation of the {@code DynamicMBean} interface
    that links the program code to JMX.</p>
